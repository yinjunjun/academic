# About me
My research interests center on computational geography for capturing and understanding the geospatial complexity in spatial human-urban environment interactions. I focus on geospatial Big Data analytics for studying urban dynamics concerning urban mobility, accessibility, and sustainability.

As a GIScientist, I am interested in understanding different interplay between human activities and the geospatial settings of urban environment. I look into human mobility patterns and its applications for understanding dynamic urban structures, with research questions addressing whether urban mobility is shaped by the underlying urban structure or the real-world human interactions actually delineate the image of a city.

To realize the research goals, my research utilize state-of-the-art methodologies, such as advanced data mining techniques, geovisual-analytics methods and high-performance computing approaches for data processing, analysis and visualization, and eventually to delineate the spatiotemporal geography in spatial Big Data. I am interested in mining and analyzing large-scale mobility data (e.g., geo-located tweets and check-ins from extracted from Location Based Social Media, taxi records and street networks) and developing new geovisual-analytics approaches in my research agenda.
